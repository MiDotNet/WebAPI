# A hands-on introduction to ASP.Net Web API 2.0

What is an API - An Application Programming Interface allows two programs to interact. In this case as it's a Web API it allows two
computers to interact over the internet.

When should I use this? - When you want to expose pieces of functionality to a wide variety of clients. Web API uses basic HTTP so
it is very flexible.

This demo uses [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) to test the Web API endpoints. A [collection of sample requests](https://github.com/aaron-lillywhite/WebAPI/blob/master/Web%20API.postman_collection.json) is included in this project and while not required will make your life easier.
